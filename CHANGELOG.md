# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Fix false Ready statuses while agents are working: recognize changing spinner
  labels, tall live screens and wrapped controls; invalidate stale prompts on
  submission, and report uncertain activity instead of guessing completion.
- Highlight workspace session states with colored borders, icons and readable
  badges. Distinguish approval requests from detected questions waiting for an
  answer, and include both in the attention count and filter.
- Keep editor selections visible on the current line in dark, light and graphite
  themes, including after focus and theme changes, without resetting undo
  history.
- Discard tracked changes from Source Control for one file or all files, with an
  explicit restore/delete preview, protection for unsaved editor buffers and
  changed-on-disk files, and support for staged edits, renames and deletions.
- Launch Windows debug builds as desktop applications without an extra console
  window whose Close button also terminates the IDE.
- Highlight environment files (`.env`, `.env.*`, and `*.env`), including keys,
  values, comments, export prefixes and quoted multiline values in every theme.
- Give the Windows Bun shell smoke test a bounded 60-second process budget and
  report launch errors, timeout details and captured output instead of a null
  exit-status assertion. Missing Bun now fails this required integration check.
- Restore Ctrl/Cmd+V and Ctrl+Shift+V paste in regular and background terminals,
  including clipboard images/files. Send a distinct Shift+Enter key for
  multiline prompts and preserve Enter, Ctrl+J, Alt+Enter and Ctrl+C behavior.
- Accept file drops and pasted image/file data in local terminal panes, with
  quoted paths, private temporary storage, bounded uploads and no automatic
  prompt submission. Explain unsupported file transfer in remote/background
  panes.
- Show agent-reported terminal titles in pane headers, agent cards, session tabs
  and background sessions. Keep manually assigned names, and preserve running
  terminals when their titles change.
- Keep the New terminal menu inside the window: open below or above the toolbar
  as space allows, scroll in short windows, and support keyboard navigation.
- Preserve colors in new terminal and agent panes even when Emdeck was started
  from a launcher with color output disabled. Apply the same behavior to
  background sessions while retaining explicit per-command color preferences.
- Add community feedback routes, structured bug/feature forms, a public roadmap,
  maintainer ownership, and a reviewed fork-to-dev contribution process.
- Protect unsaved manual merge drafts when closing immediately after typing,
  including before React finishes updating the interface.
- Resolve conflicts in a file-list modal with complete Ours/Theirs choices and a
  three-pane manual merge editor. Results are staged per file, with draft
  preservation, stale-version checks, binary/deletion handling and explicit
  rebase labels. See [merge conflict resolution](docs/MERGE-CONFLICTS.md).
- Keep the Welcome page fully scrollable in short panes and show shared
  scrollbars only while hovering containers with overflowing content.

- Use `main` for reviewed source and `dev` for ongoing development; validate
  both branches and keep routine dependency updates on `dev`.
- Allow the Bun shell integration test to use its existing 15-second child
  process budget on Windows CI instead of timing out after five seconds.
- Publication scans cover every tracked file and publishable new source file,
  plus all fetched Git history, without path exclusions or inline suppressions.
  Local credential/configuration folders are ignored, and documentation omits
  internal project names and directory structures.
- Experimental Emdeck-owned headless session server and optional Background
  sessions view. Local/SSH workspace inventories, unattached agent status,
  explicit control ownership, detach/stop, and cold layout restoration.
- Authenticated bounded JSON API and CLI for pane creation, input, prompts,
  waits and lifecycle reports. Opt-in Claude hook adapter and registered native
  Claude/Codex resume; standalone Rust binary has no Tauri/WebView dependency.

- Optional Workspaces terminal view with working-directory spaces, session tabs,
  attention filtering, and preserved terminal/editor lifetime.
- Saved, explicit connections to existing cmux TUI and tmux sessions over SSH,
  with custom SSH shell/command support, disconnect and reconnect controls.
- Claude Remote Control and other HTTPS provider-session links open their
  official browser interfaces. Remote status/usage capabilities are labeled.
- Native argv validation and per-window ownership; no automatic connection,
  remote server installation, provider login, or local usage probing for
  remotes.

## 0.1.22 — First public beta

- Lightweight file editing, Markdown previews, and independent project windows.
- Multiple terminal agents with configurable layouts and usage summaries.
- Git branch trees and action submenus, diff tabs, merge conflict tools and
  worktrees.
- Detected/custom run commands, recent commands, and Bun support.
- Dark/light themes, persistent layout, and last-project restoration.
- Organized feature architecture and typed native command boundaries.
- Open-source license, contributor/security/privacy documentation, and bundled
  dependency notices.
- Patched test dependencies, source/history secret scans, Rust advisory checks,
  and immutable CI action references.
- Four-target build/release workflows, signing integration, checksums, installer
  checks and an opt-in terminal soak test.
- Atomic saves retry brief Windows file locks while preserving external-change
  checks and unsaved editor content.
- Terminal layout and size changes keep following live output when the pane was
  at the bottom, while preserving deliberate scrollback reading.
- Windows terminals preserve launch-environment overrides, including tools added
  to `PATH` by a shell or tool manager.

**Unsigned beta:** Windows builds are unsigned; macOS builds use ad-hoc signing
without notarization. Operating-system warnings or device policy may prevent
launching them.

Test environments: Windows 11 x64 locally and Windows Server 2025 x64 in CI,
macOS 15.7.9 on Apple Silicon and Intel, and Ubuntu 24.04.5 x64. Linux downloads
are Ubuntu `.deb` packages. Other OS versions/distributions are not covered by
these results.

Auto-update, durable recovery of unsaved files, and agent reattachment after a
restart are not included. Provider usage fields depend on the installed CLI and
account. See [Validation](docs/VALIDATION.md) and the release's validation
record for completed checks and measurement scope.

## 0.1.21 — Unpublished release candidate

Installed Windows validation found that the terminal library replaced inherited
`PATH` entries with registry defaults, hiding Bun installed by the CI setup.
Publication was held for the 0.1.22 fix; the existing candidate tag was
preserved.

## 0.1.20 — Unpublished release candidate

Release validation found that resizing streaming terminal panes could leave
their views in older scrollback. Output remained intact. Publication was held
for the 0.1.21 fix; the existing candidate tag was preserved.

Earlier versions were local development builds. Their validation history remains
in `docs/VALIDATION.md`.
