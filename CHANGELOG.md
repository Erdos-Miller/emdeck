# Changelog

## 0.1.20 — First public beta

- Multiple terminal agents with configurable layouts and usage summaries.
- Git branch trees and action submenus, diff tabs, merge conflict tools and
  worktrees.
- Detected/custom run commands, recent commands, and Bun support.
- Dark/light themes, persistent layout, and last-project restoration.
- Organized feature architecture and typed native command boundaries.
- Open-source license, contributor/security/privacy documentation, and bundled
  dependency notices.
- Patched test dependencies, source/history secret scans, Rust advisory checks,
  and immutable CI action references.
- Four-target build/release workflows, signing integration, checksums, installer

**Unsigned beta:** Windows builds are unsigned; macOS builds use ad-hoc signing
without notarization. Operating-system warnings or device policy may prevent
launching them.

Test environments: Windows 11 x64 locally and Windows Server 2025 x64 in CI,
macOS 15.7.9 on Apple Silicon and Intel, and Ubuntu 24.04.5 x64. Linux downloads
are Ubuntu `.deb` packages. Other OS versions/distributions are not covered by
these results.

Auto-update, durable recovery of unsaved files, and agent reattachment after a
restart are not included. Provider usage fields depend on the installed CLI and
account. See [Validation](docs/VALIDATION.md) and the release's validation
record for completed checks and measurement scope.

Earlier versions were local development builds. Their validation history remains
in `docs/VALIDATION.md`.
